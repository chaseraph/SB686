            <!-- INTRODUCTORY TEXT -->
            <div class="mt-8 mb-12 text-left space-y-6 font-sans text-slate-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <p>
                    The concept of forcing massive tech companies who, in my view, are taking journalism content and using it in a way that amounts to theft is serious and I applaud Oregon legislators for trying to address that while providing funding for our local media ecosystem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Last year's bill, SB 686, which I understand will be resurrected for the 2026 short session, is not the way to do it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In their zeal, I fear legislators will end up doing incredible, irreversible harm to Oregon's growing independent journalism industry while enriching out-of-state corporations and reducing the content and quality of journalism in communities covered by tiny independent newspapers like mine.
                </p>
                <p class="font-bold text-slate-900 border-l-4 border-red-500 pl-4 bg-red-50 p-4 rounded-r">
                    The bill as written leaves small, locally-owned outfits scrambling for a tiny pot of funds that they must ask for in grant form in competition with non-journalism organizations asking for the same funding, which is very difficult for solo newsrooms to do due to staff and time constraints, while large chain corporations from out-of-state get to subsidize their journalists with easily accessed cash payments
                </p>
                <p>
                    I and my indie colleagues are committed to finding new and exciting ways to fund our robust journalism, like events, classes, and philanthropy, to name just a few. This bill would enrich our large out-of-state competitors, who would use their sudden influx of cash, if it ever materializes, to crush us with a regional model that focuses on only providing news in the largest communities while siphoning up ad dollars and subscribers in the overlooked communities we focus on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The bill runs the risk that Meta and Google will simply ban news links as they have threatened, or in Canada's case, followed through on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Google tested <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/12/google-removing-links-to-california-news-websites-after-state-bill-.html" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 underline hover:text-blue-800">shutting off link traffic</a> in California when similar legislation was proposed, and Meta/Facebook still <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/one-year-after-news-ban-canadian-journalism-is-suffering-but-meta-isn-t-budging-1.7281101" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 underline hover:text-blue-800">does not allow</a> news links on their sites in Canada because of their bargaining code law, the Online News Act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like it or not, Meta and Google drive a huge amount of traffic to our largely digital newspaper. We will close if Meta or Google ban news links.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This bill should not have been introduced last year without input from small publications. Now, legislators are considering trying to ram it through in a 35 day session, giving folks like me very little time to see what's in the bill and respond.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have gone through last year's bill and highlighted just a few concerning sections; they are not all of them, but they stand out.

                        This immediately cuts out every solo owner-operated newsroom in Oregon, or newsrooms working with volunteers that are not nonprofits or small newsrooms that only employ someone for 29 hours etc.

                        This is another serious example of the unequal tier this creates that will harm small newsrooms. While largely out-of-state corps will benefit from getting cold hard cash if the bill works, small outfits like mine will be left to apply for grants, using our precious time to beg for small amounts of money that must be reviewed and awarded and this language will allow non-journalism programs to seek money from a journalism funding bill. Why? All language awarding this money to anything other than a journalism outfit should be tossed.

                        I am completely opposed to elected leaders choosing who chooses which news organizations to fund. Journalism must remain independent to serve a watchdog role on government.
